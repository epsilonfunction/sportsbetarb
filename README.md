Sports Betting Arbitrage

This is a test of webscraping and data analytics.

The objective here is to find out if there is any betting arbitrage opportunity between betting sites.

Key Steps:
1) Webscraping from betting sites
    Targets:
        - Singapore Pools
	- 
2) Use Apache Airflow to orchestrate the different python webscraping files
3) Warehouse it on local PostgreSQL/NoSQL database. 
4) Find ways to arbitrage it

Focus on Football ONLY for now
